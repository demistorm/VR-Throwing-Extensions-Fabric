# VR Throwing Extensions-Fabric
Fabric mod allowing players to throw and catch any item!

Simply hold the attack/destroy keybind, make a throwing motion, and release!
Hold the place/use keybind at the same time to throw the whole stack. 

To catch a thrown item, reach towards it with an empty hand and simply hold the attack/destroy keybind. Like an opposite throw!

*Requires Vivecraft Mod 1.3.0+. Mod Menu recommended to change clientside settings.*

**Built for 1.21.5** (Backports coming at some point...)
